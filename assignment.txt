Requirements:
I would like to validate if an entered credit card number is a valid credit card number using the Luhn algorithm. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

A user should be able to enter a credit card number into a React based UI where the validation logic is a node powered express service.
